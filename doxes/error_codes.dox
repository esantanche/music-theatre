 * @subsection W3E001 W3E001 Unknow term
 *
 * @descr An unknow term has been found
 * Scanning the programmes, we encountered a taxonomy term that we didn't get when loading the entire taxonomy.

 * running.
 * It happens here:
 * @see musth_rules.taxonomy_apes_build.inc

 *
 * @descr Parent term not found
 * When we compute the number of occurrences of a term in programmes, we have to add these occurrences to any parent the term has.
 * When this error happens, it's because we didn't find the parent term.
 * The parent term should exist because the api taxonomy_get_tree is supposed to return it
 * It happens here:

 * @descr Programme not found! It should be there!
 * This is serious. We attempted to load a programme the tagring requested
 * If the tagring requested that programme, it means that it got the nid
 * of that programme from us.
 * If the programme isn't there either the database if off or there is

 * @descr The tagring sent an empty array of ids
 * The tagring requested for some programmes, but the array that should contain
 * the node ids of the wanted programmes is empty.
 * Actually we discovered that the tagring does send empty arrays sometimes
 * and that we have just to ignore it.
 * So, this error shouldn't be used any more.
 * It happens here:

 * We attempted to load an ape that we need to filter programmes.
